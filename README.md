In this project, we train the snake by updating the Q values based on the rewards and actions that are defined.
There are 2 stages for danger, 4 for moving directions, and 8 for food directions.
and we have a total of 256 statuses for states and this is the minimal number of states.
After training for a while our snake presents a better performance.
